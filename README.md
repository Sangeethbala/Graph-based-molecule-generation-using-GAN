# Graph-based-molecule-generation-using-GAN

• The key challenge of drug discovery is to find target molecules with desired chemical properties.
• Developed a graph based generative model using Junction Tree Variational Auto encoder and
WGAN which provided 100% valid molecule generation and predicted improved reward distribution.
• Manual features were extracted from molecules such as sum over bonds, fingerprints to guide GAN
to generate molecules with specific features.
